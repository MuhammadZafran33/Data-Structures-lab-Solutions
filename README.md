# 📘 data structures lab solutions

welcome to the **data structures lab solutions** repository!  
this repo contains solutions, implementations, and notes for **data structures** problems taught in the lab sessions at **im sciences, peshawar**, as well as additional practice problems solved at home.

## 👤 about me
Hi! I am **Muhammad Zafran**,  
🎓 a **3rd semester student of artificial intelligence** at **institute of management sciences (im sciences), peshawar**.  

this repository reflects my journey of learning and practicing data structures in c++. it is a mix of lab assignments, personal practice, and extra notes to strengthen my understanding.

---

## 🎯 purpose of this repository
- to organize and store all data structure lab solutions in one place  
- to practice and reinforce concepts taught in class  
- to share learning with classmates and juniors  
- to build a strong foundation for advanced subjects like algorithms, ai, and machine learning

## 📂 repository structure
the repository is divided into folders based on lab topics:  


---

## 📖 topics covered
this repository will eventually cover the following topics:  

- ✅ pointers & dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `calloc`, `new`)  
- ✅ basic c++ programs with arrays  
- ⏳ linked lists (singly, doubly, circular)  
- ⏳ stacks and queues  
- ⏳ searching and sorting algorithms (linear, binary, bubble, quick, merge, etc.)  
- ⏳ trees (bst, avl)  
- ⏳ graphs (dfs, bfs, shortest path algorithms)  
- ⏳ hashing techniques  
- ⏳ complexity analysis  

*(✅ = completed, ⏳ = in progress, 📌 = upcoming)*

## 🧑‍💻 learning outcomes

by solving these problems, i aim to:

. understand the core principles of data structures

. strengthen problem-solving and logical thinking

. practice dynamic memory allocation in c++

. prepare for algorithms and ai-related subjects

. create a personal reference guide for data structures


## 📌 future goals

. add more lab solutions as the semester progresses

. include detailed comments and explanations for every code

. document time complexity of each algorithm

. add diagrams and flowcharts for better understanding

. provide practice exercises at the end of each folder
